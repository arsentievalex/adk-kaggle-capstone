Subject: AI to Accelerate Revolut UK's Banking Operations & Global Scale

Carlos,

Congratulations again on Revolut securing its UK banking license earlier this year – a monumental achievement that underscores your leadership in building out the necessary infrastructure.

As Revolut moves into this critical "mobilisation stage" and aims for 100 million customers across new markets, balancing rapid global scalability, stringent regulatory compliance, and a personalized 'super app' experience presents unique technological challenges. Our Google Cloud AI portfolio, including Vertex AI and Gemini, is designed to tackle these very demands, empowering your teams to drive efficiency and innovation at scale.

For instance, Clearco, a fintech specializing in foreign exchange and cross-border payments—a core Revolut business area—leverages Vertex AI for its AI-driven Know Your Business (KYB) compliance. This solution has improved their productivity by 30 times and significantly reduced onboarding times, eliminating manual bottlenecks, which is critical for aggressive customer acquisition while ensuring regulatory adherence.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute conversation to explore how Google Cloud AI can further accelerate Revolut's operational efficiency and compliance as you scale?

Best regards,

John Doe
Senior Account Executive

"Hi Carlos, John Doe with Google Cloud.

Firstly, congratulations on Revolut securing its UK banking license – a huge milestone, and I know you were instrumental.

Given Revolut's ambitious goal of reaching 100 million customers and the focus on building out robust banking operations, I believe our AI portfolio, like Vertex AI and Gemini, can significantly help. We've enabled other fintechs, such as Clearco, to accelerate KYB compliance 30x, dramatically speeding up customer onboarding.

I'd love a quick 15 minutes to share how this might benefit Revolut. Would next Tuesday or Thursday work for a brief call?"
